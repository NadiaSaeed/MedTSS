Allgeier and Abel Valdivia, journal name Nature Communications. 'Fishing is widely considered a leading cause of biodiversity loss in marine environments, but the potential effect on ecosystem processes, such as nutrient fluxes, is less explored.  Here, we test how fishing on Caribbean coral reefs influences biodiversity and ecosystem functions provided by the fish community, that is, fish-mediated nutrient capacity.  Specifically, we modelled five processes of nutrient storage and supply of nutrients, as well as a measure of their multifunctionality, onto 143 species of coral reef fishes across 110 coral reef fish communities.  These communities span a gradient from extreme fishing pressure to protected areas with little to no fishing.  Instead, changes in community size and trophic structure were the primary cause of shifts in ecosystem function.  These findings suggest that a broader perspective that incorporates predictable impacts of fishing pressure on ecosystem function is imperative for effective coral reef conservation and management.'  ', 'The productivity of many ecosystems depends on the nutrient capacity of the ecosystem; here defined as the total nutrients stored within, and the rate at which nutrients are recycled between the constituents of the system4,5.  Coral reefs are replete with solar energy, but have low ambient nutrient availability and typically receive little sustained exogenous nutrient input5,6.  Thus, the high rates of production found within these ecosystems are largely attributed to the nutrients stored and cycled by living biomass7,8,9.  ', 'Fishes typically make up a substantial component of living biomass on coral reefs and represent an important reservoir of nutrients in these ecosystems10,11.  The removal of biomass via fishing likely has substantial implications for the nutrient capacity of coral reefs because: nutrients are removed from the system and existing nutrients are shunted into alternative pathways and storage pools such as, invertebrates, macroalgae and microorganisms.  Further, because exogenous nutrient inputs to reefs are sparse, the replacement rate of nutrients that are removed via fishing is likely slow7,8,12a dynamic that is analogous to the disruption of nutrient cycles in tropical rainforests following intensive timber harvest13.  ', 'Fish-mediated nutrient capacity is determined by a complex combination of species-level traits, such as stoichiometry and metabolism, that scale with individual body size14.  At the community level, fish nutrient capacity is determined by distinct aspects of community structure beyond biomass11,15.  Yet, it is unknown how fishing pressure, particularly through selective exploitation of certain species, alters fish nutrient capacity of coral reef ecosystems.  ', 'Here we estimated the effects of fishing pressure on coral reef fish nutrient capacity in 110 fish communities on 43 Caribbean coral reefs.  Pressure ranged from reefs with minimal fishing within relatively well-enforced no-take marine reserves, to heavily fished reefs with no protection where large predatory fish are mostly absent and overall size distribution of fish communities are relatively small.  Our goals were to: test how different aspects of fish community structure, including richness, evenness, trophic structure, size structure and biomass, influence fish nutrient capacity; assess how fishing pressure alters fish nutrient capacity across a fishing gradient; and identify the primary drivers of reduced fish nutrient capacity due to fishing pressure.  ', 'Our results support commonly assumed theoretical relationships between species richness and ecosystem function; however, when accounting for the biomass of the communities, this relationship is nonexistent.  Fishing reduced fish-mediated nutrient processes by nearly half, but, contrary to expectations, reduction in nutrient processes was not due to species loss.  Instead, changes in trophic and size structure of the fish community was the main driver in reduced ecosystem function.  Species extirpation/extinction is a critical conservation concern, but our analysis suggests that efforts to preserve trophic groups and community size structure are also needed to maintain fish-mediated nutrient capacity in coral reef ecosystems.'  Species richness and mean biomass-weighted trophic level of the community were the best predictors of nutrient capacity.  To disentangle the relative importance of biomass for all nutrient processes, we performed a second analysis with all response variables as biomass-specific processes.  Thus, we were able to assess the relative importance of aspects of community structure beyond any inherent relationship with biomass.  When accounting for biomass, richness was no longer an important predictor, but instead community size structure and trophic structure emerged as the most important predictors.  All models included six parameters: species richness, species evenness, Trophic Group evenness, mean biomass-weighted trophic level, mean maximum size per species and skewness of the size frequency distribution of the community.  Mean weighted parameter estimates for the same processes as in panel, but here corrected for relative biomass.Full size image', 'These findings reveal two primary insights.  Second, when considering the cumulative species-level effects on nutrient processes beyond the effect of biomass, the number of species within a community is a poor predictor.  This result highlights the differential importance of body size and diet,, because smaller fish recycle nitrogen at higher rates due to higher metabolism, but excrete less phosphorous relative to larger fish due to a low P diet14,17.  ', 'Fishing reduces nutrient capacity in coral reefs', 'The next step in our analysis was to understand how humans mediate ecosystem function and the drivers associated with this change.  Nutrient capacity mediated by coral reef fishes was substantially decreased by fishing and lack of protection.  This finding was determined by using mixed-effects models for all nutrient processes and five predictor variables associated with fishing and environmental characteristics of the system.  A continuous measure of human population density18, and a categorical measure of protection status no-take marine reserves with age 1842 years, or areas open to fishing) were the most important predictors and were included in all top models.  This difference is particularly notable when comparing fished and protected reefs, whereby fishing pressure reduced nutrient capacity 4046%.  ', 'Figure 2: The relative importance of factors influencing fish nutrient capacity on reefs.  Error bars indicate s.e.Full size image', 'Identifying the drivers through which fishing reduces nutrient capacity in coral reefs is critical for informing appropriate fisheries management strategies to maintain ecosystem functions.  We tested the effect of fishing pressure on the two best predictors of nutrient capacity, TL and Richness, as well as on Biomass.  Human population density was associated with substantially lower community TL than Biomass and Richness and explained more of the variation in community TL and Biomass than Richnessthe same trends were found when using the categorical variable of fished and protected reefs.  This finding supports previous assertions that fishing in coral reefs targets particular species, often those with higher trophic position that are generally larger19,20.  Proportionately small differences in species richness were found between fished and protected reefs across the exploitation gradient.  However, strong reductions in nutrient processes were found across all trophic groups between fished and protected reefs despite only minor reductions in richness.  These findings underscore the disproportionate influence of altered size and trophic structure, not species loss, for nutrient capacity in the context of fishing pressure.

Distributions represent bootstrapped per cent reductions in nutrient processes for each trophic group between fished and protected reefs.Full size image'  'One mechanism by which species richness could be maintained despite selective fishing is through functional redundancy, whereby high levels of richness within trophic groups distributes the effect of fishing pressure across species1,15,21.  Biodiversity theory predicts that high levels of functional redundancy should also help sustain high levels of ecosystem function22.  However, across the fishing gradient, reduction in richness within a trophic group was not correlated with reductions in any process by that trophic group, with the exception of N supply, suggesting certain species disproportionately influence ecosystem function.  Ecosystem function cannot be maintained simply by the presence of high numbers of species, as many other changes occur in the structure of the communities with fishing pressure23,24.  We show that targeted fishing of higher trophic levels is reducing the capacity of coral reef fish communities to store and recycle nutrients by nearly half.  Fish-mediated nutrients enhance coral growth26 and primary production27, and may regulate nutrient ratios at the ecosystem scale11.  Our findings underscore the growing need to incorporate animal-mediated nutrient dynamics in models of ecosystem function, particularly in light of the rapid rate of exploitation of animal biomass throughout the world3.  Improved models of nutrient dynamics on coral reefs will also enhance our understanding of the negative impacts of anthropogenic nutrients for coral reefs that is drastically needed for conservation and management.  ', 'We provide perspectives on one aspect of nutrient capacity in coral reef ecosystems, using a snapshot view of fish-mediated nutrients based on animal biomass.

Wylie and Kalev Freeman, journal name {PLOS} {ONE}. Functional neuroimaging studies in mild traumatic brain injury have been largely limited to patients with persistent post-concussive symptoms, utilizing images obtained months to years after the actual head trauma.  We also hypothesized that increased memory workload at 1 week following injury would expose different cortical activation patterns in mTBI patients with persistent post-concussive symptoms, compared to those with full clinical recovery.  We performed a prospective, cohort study of working memory in emergency department patients with isolated head injury and clinical diagnosis of concussion, compared to control subjects.  The primary outcome of cognitive recovery was defined as resolution of reported cognitive impairment and quantified by scoring the subjects reported cognitive post-concussive symptoms at 1 week.  Secondary outcomes included additional post-concussive symptoms and neurocognitive testing results.  We enrolled 46 subjects: 27 with mild TBI and 19 controls.  hours after injury.  At follow up, 18 of mTBI subjects reported moderate to complete cognitive recovery, 8 of whom fully recovered between initial and follow-up imaging.  Increases in activation were greater in those mTBI subjects without cognitive recovery.  In summary, we found neuroimaging evidence for working memory deficits during the first week following mild traumatic brain injury.  Subjects with persistent cognitive symptoms after mTBI had increased requirement for posterior cingulate activation to complete memory tasks at 1 week following a brain injury.  These results provide insight into functional activation patterns during initial recovery from mTBI and expose the regional activation networks that may be involved in working memory deficits.  Cognitive Improvement after Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Measured with Functional Neuroimaging during the Acute Period.  Traumatic Brain Injury is a significant medical problem worldwide, with as many as 1.7 million people in the US sustaining a head injury each year.  The majority of TBIs are mild, and not all individuals who sustain a head injury present to the emergency department.  While it appears most individuals with mTBI will recover without lengthy post-concussive syndrome, there are currently no known clinical measurements that can predict which patient will experience persistent deleterious outcomes including cognitive, emotional, somatic and physical deficits.  There is a growing literature on the impact of mTBI on the brain using neuroimaging tools.  Much has been learned through the investigation of changes in the blood oxygen level dependent signal during task performance as well the investigation of changes in functional brain connectivity using the covariation in the BOLD signal from disparate brain regions.  Much of the research into task-based brain activation has focused on working memory tasks, since working memory is one of the domains primarily affected by mTBI.  Notably, this mild form of injury induces persisting cognitive dysfunction in approximately 1520 percent of patients each year, exacting an enormous emotional and financial toll on society.  Another observation that is emerging from the mTBI literature is the importance of the integrity of the default network, a network of brain areas that is more active when subjects are at rest than when engaged in a cognitive task.  Importantly, activity in the DN appears to change as a function of recovery such that as post-concussive symptoms abate, metrics of functional connectivity return to normal levels.  While the work that has been conducted to date investigating the consequences of mTBI on brain activation has led to a better understanding of how the brain responds to trauma, only a few studies have studied subjects at time points within the first month following injury, and we are unaware of any studies to date that have enrolled patients at their initial medical contact in the emergency department setting.  Therefore, while the extant literature provides important insight about the reorganization of brain function, it is not generalizable to the wider context of acute head injuries, and cannot predict which subjects will recover and which will not.  Our objective was to understand the effect of concussive head injury on working memory, at the earliest possible time point after a concussion and in the first week of recovery.  We compared patients diagnosed with mTBI in the emergency department to controls using the N-back task for working memory and sequential neuroimaging at two early time points after trauma.  We hypothesized that clinical and fMRI measures of working memory would be abnormal in mTBI patients immediately after injury, but these measures would improve in those patients with clinical recovery within 1 week.  Regarding the fMRI measures, we specifically predicted that the mTBI group would show hypoactivation on the 0-back task immediately after injury.  We also hypothesized that increased memory workload at 1 week following injury would expose different activation patterns in those mTBI patients with persistent symptoms, compared to those with full clinical recovery.  Eligible patients were those aged 1860 years old who presented to the emergency department with isolated head injury, and medical diagnosis of a concussion based on standard emergency department criteria of Glasgow Coma Scale  greater than  14 at the time of injury.  Concussion was defined as a patient with acute head trauma endorsing two or more of the following symptoms associated with their injury: loss of consciousness, persistent headache, blurred vision, confusion, dizziness, memory problems or poor balance.  Patients were excluded if: 1) they did not exhibit two or more concussive symptoms; 2) had a past history of a serious TBI; 3) they were unable to complete initial MRI within 72 hours of injury; 4) they had a pre-existing neurological disorder; 5) they had a psychiatric condition requiring medical treatment within the past year; 6) any contraindications to MRI scanning.  Two control groups were also recruited: normal volunteers without acute injury who responded to flier advertisements and non-head injured patients who presented with an extremity injury to the emergency department within 72 hours of injury.  Extremity injury was defined as a non-surgical injury to the arms or legs, including the shoulder and hips, with no head trauma.  Following the first MRI all subjects completed the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing computerized neurocognitive testing battery.  The ImPACT test measures attention span, working memory, sustained and selective attention, response variability, non-verbal problem solving and reaction time, each of which is sensitive for mild cognitive impairment.  Repeat MRI and ImPACT testing was done 710 days following injury.  Among these symptoms, we defined cognitive symptoms as difficulty concentrating, difficulty remembering, feeling mentally foggy, feeling slowed down, drowsiness, fatigue and sleeping more than usual as previously defined by factor analysis.  The primary outcome of clinical recovery for individual patients, was defined as resolution of reported cognitive symptoms prior to time 2; other symptoms and ImPACT results were reported as secondary outcomes.  Secondary outcomes of neurocognitive testing results, were reported in the same fashion for both the experimental groups and subgroups.  Participants consisted of 27 mild TBI patients, 10 orthopedic controls and 9 healthy controls.  The mTBI patients were enrolled in the study within 72 hours of injury and while the research MRI scanner was available, and returned for a second scan 1 week later.  Of the 25 mTBI patients eight mTBIs reported complete recovery from all cognitive symptoms between scan 1 and scan 2, ten mTBIs reported minimal recovery by the completion of the second scan, and the remainder reported moderate recovery.  In comparison of subjects with cognitive recovery to those with no cognitive recovery, there were no differences in demographics, initial symptoms or neurocognitive measurements at the initial time point.  The secondary outcomes of neurocognitive results at time 2 were similar at both time points for those subjects with and without resolution of cognitive symptoms as shown by the overlapping 95% confidence intervals for each of these measures.  In this study, we set out to better understand the consequences of mild TBI on brain function, focusing on the first week after injury.  We scanned individuals with mTBI twice: first within 72 hours of their injury to capture acute changes, and then 710 days later to assess recovery.  This is the first study to our knowledge to longitudinally investigate working memory within the first week on injury in mTBI patients.  We also differentiated between those patients who reported cognitive recovery, and those with persistent cognitive symptoms.  Demographics, initial symptoms, neurocognitive measures at time 1, CT scans, and structural MRI, did not provide any predictive power to discriminate the primary outcome of recovery at 1 week.  While there is a growing body of work investigating working memory in TBI, much of this work has examined chronic injury, with scans acquired monthsoften yearsafter the injury has occurred.  Much can be learned from this work; however, it is unclear from this work whether the reorganization that is seen in chronic samples is qualitatively similar to acute changes in brain function.  The results of the current study show a pattern of results that is qualitatively similar to this previous work in individuals who do not recover at 1 week after injury: increased activation in the right, often prefrontal, cortex when the activation of individuals who have sustained a TBI is compared with controls.  While the replication of previous results in an acute sample is encouraging, the data from the 0-back task collected within 72 hours of injury is perhaps more important.  The DN is a set of regions that have been shown to be significantly more active when subjects are at rest than when they are engaged in effortful processing, individuals with a mild TBI did not recover; when activation in these areas was relatively high during the 0-back task, individuals with mTBI did recover.  While any interpretation of these findings must remain highly speculative, it is possible that hypoactivation of the DN is a signal that the brain has to work harder to accomplish even the relatively simple 0-back task.  It is therefore tempting to conclude that the mTBIs in our sample who showed hypoactivation in their DNs and did not recover had to expend more cognitive resources on the 0-back task than the subjects who were able to maintain activation in their DNs and later recovered.  We enrolled subjects in the emergency department and performed structured interviews and neurocognitive testing at the bedside.  At initial presentation after head injury, our research staff was able to ascertain reliable information about the event, which is subject to recall bias in other studies that have enrolled patients at later time points.  We performed comprehensive clinical evaluations at follow-up to provide characterization of functional recovery in the early phase after mTBI.  A second strength is the early neuroimaging obtained by bringing emergency department patients directly to a research magnet.  This study design allowed us to obtain a large series of MRIs with corresponding clinical information during the early time period after mTBI.  It is only through obtaining data at multiple time points that the mechanisms of functional recovery can be inferred.  Our exclusion criteria might be considered less stringent than other studies, because we enrolled all adult emergency department patients with mTBI, only excluding past history of TBI requiring surgical intervention, psychiatric condition within the last year, or active alcohol/ drug intoxication.  Despite our attempts to include a diverse population of mTBI patients, our sample may not represent the whole mild traumatic brain injury population.  Additionally, we were unable to capture the true initial time point after injury, and the timing of the first MRI varied between 11 hours and 72 hours after trauma.  Functional recovery after brain injury may begin to occur immediately, and the earliest changes in cortical activation patterns would not be detected with our study design.  The injury mechanisms were variable and although we documented the patients report of the mechanism, the actual injury parameters are unknown.  This may be problematic, because patients may have deficits that are not apparent to them, but only manifested on neurocognitive testing.  In fact, our secondary outcomes of neurocognitive testing did not reveal significant differences in cognitive performance in patients who reported cognitive recovery compared to those who did not.  Without pre-injury neurocognitive testing the results of tests obtained after injury can only be compared to standardized databases and tracked over time.  However, inasmuch as pre-injury testing was not available on the individuals in this study, we felt that the patients report of cognitive improvement and resolution of symptoms was the most valid clinical outcome measure.  Future work will be to develop inexpensive, sensitive, diagnostic measures that correlate with changes in brain activation, and that can be easily administered in clinical settings to predict recovery.  We describe patterns of brain activation during working memory tasks in the acute and sub-acute phases after mTBI.  Additionally, stronger engagement of working memory resulted in increased, possibly compensatory, recruitment of right-lateralized frontal and parietal regions in patients who did not recover 1 week after the injury.  Our results provide critical insight into functional activation of working memory networks during the early phase of recovery after mTBI.\n","Published by Public Library of Science ({PLoS}) authors Glenn R.

Lewis, journal name {PLOS} Medicine. Mobile text messaging and medication monitors have the potential to improve adherence to tuberculosis treatment and reduce the need for directly observed treatment, but to our knowledge they have not been properly evaluated in TB patients.  We assessed the effectiveness of text messaging and medication monitors to improve medication adherence in TB patients.  Patients in the intervention arms received reminders to take their drugs and reminders for monthly follow-up visits, and the managing doctor was recommended to switch patients with adherence problems to more intensive management or DOT.  In all arms, patients took medications out of a medication monitor box, which recorded when the box was opened, but the box gave reminders only in the medication monitor and combined arms.  The primary endpoint was the percentage of patient-months on TB treatment where at least 20% of doses were missed as measured by pill count and failure to open the medication monitor box.  Secondary endpoints included additional adherence and standard treatment outcome measures.  The cluster geometric mean of the percentage of patient-months on TB treatment where at least 20% of doses were missed was 29.9% in the control arm; in comparison, this percentage was 27.3% in the text messaging arm, 17.0% in the medication monitor arm, and 13.9% in the combined arm.  Patient loss to follow-up was lower in the text messaging arm than the control arm.  Analyses separating patients with and without medication monitor problems did not change the results.  This study is the first to our knowledge to utilise a randomised trial design to demonstrate the effectiveness of a medication monitor to improve medication adherence in TB patients.  Reminders from medication monitors improved medication adherence in TB patients, but text messaging reminders did not.  In a setting such as China where universal use of DOT is not feasible, innovative approaches to support patients in adhering to TB treatment, such as this, are needed.  To improve medication adherence, the World Health Organization recommends that health care workers supervise patients while they take their medication.  In China, for example, where 11% of tuberculosis cases occur, DOT cannot be implemented in many parts of the country, and the national tuberculosis control policy permits self-administered treatment and treatment monitored by family members.  It is estimated that over half of individuals with tuberculosis in China self-administer their treatment, but, in 2010, 20% of patients treated using nationally recommended case-management approaches were lost to follow-up or failed to take their medications regularly.  In this pragmatic cluster-randomized trial, the researchers investigate whether reminders delivered by mobile phone or by medication monitor boxes might improve tuberculosis medication adherence in China.  The researchers assigned people newly diagnosed with tuberculosis in counties/districts to receive reminders about taking their antibiotics and about monthly follow-up visits via text messaging, a medication monitor, or both text messaging and a medication monitor, or to receive standard nationally recommended care without electronic reminders.  All the trial participants took their drugs out of a medication monitor box, but the boxs audio reminder function was switched off in the text messaging only and control arms.  In the intervention arms, doctors were advised to switch participants with poor medication adherence to either more intensive management or DOT, depending on the level of missed treatment doses.  Compared to the control arm, the percentage of patient-months with at least 20% of the drug doses missed was not significantly reduced in the text messaging arm, whereas poor adherence was significantly reduced by 42% and 51% in the medication monitor and the combined arms, respectively.  Notably, fewer patients were switched to intensive management or DOT than expected based on medication adherence evaluations.  These findings show that, in China, the use of an electronic medication monitor box to remind patients to take their anti-tuberculosis drugs improved medication adherence.  Interestingly, text messaging alone, which has been shown to improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy among HIV-positive individuals, did not improve medication adherence among patients with tuberculosis, possibly because the messages were too frequent or too impersonal, although this intervention did reduce patient loss to follow-up.  Battery problems with the medication monitor may have resulted in over-estimation of poor adherence to treatment.  Moreover, the researchers assumption that opening the medication monitor box is synonymous with taking the medication may have introduced some inaccuracies into these findings.  Despite these limitations and the underuse of more intensive case management in patients with poor adherence, these findings suggest that using medication monitors to deliver electronic drug reminders to patients might improve medication adherence among patients with tuberculosis in China and in other settings.  Effectiveness of Electronic Reminders to Improve Medication Adherence in Tuberculosis Patients: A Cluster-Randomised Trial.              electronic medication packaging; IQR,  Initially, the use of directly observed treatment by health care workers was the primary approach to ensure TB treatment adherence.  In the 2010 National Tuberculosis Prevalence Survey, 20% of TB patients treated by the public health systemusing national TB case-management approacheswere lost to follow-up or were not taking their medications regularly.  Electronic reminders and monitoring have been used in several disease conditions to improve medication adherence.  The potential of mobile phone technology to improve the quality and delivery of health care, including diagnosis, treatment adherence, and data collection, has been recognised.  Mobile phone text messaging has been shown to improve adherence to antiretroviral treatment and outcomes in HIV-positive patients.  However, aside from in a small-scale pilot study, the use of text messaging has not been rigorously evaluated in TB patients.  Electronic medication packaging devices can remind patients to take medications on time, monitor time of drug intake, and alert health care workers to patients who have missed doses.  Using adherence data from medication monitor boxes to select less adherent patients for counselling or more intensive forms of case management has been suggested but not studied.  To evaluate the use of electronic reminders to improve medication adherence in TB patients, we conducted a cluster-randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of three case-management approachesusing reminders via text messaging, a medication monitor, or bothcompared to the standard of care in China.  Those in the control arm were managed according to the standard of care of the National Tuberculosis Control Program.  Those in the three intervention arms also received reminders to take their medications from text messages via short message service, a medication monitor, or both.  If adherence problems were subsequently detected, more intensive management was recommended.  Inclusion criteria included the following: no communication impairment, patient at least 18 y old, and patient or family member able to use mobile phone to read SMS text messages and use the medication monitor after training.  All patients were treated according to National Tuberculosis Control Program guidelines including the use of isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide for 2 mo, followed by isoniazid and rifampin for 4 mo; the programme used every other day dosing for the entire treatment course.  Patients received their blister-pack medications in a medication monitor box that electronically collected the date and time of each opening.  In the control and text messaging arms, the medication monitor box was in silent mode and was not used as a reminder tool for patients.  At each monthly visit, patients were dispensed enough medications for a 1-mo period.  At the start of treatment, the doctor and the patient selected one of three treatment monitoring approaches as per National Tuberculosis Control Program protocol: self-administered treatment, treatment supervised by family members, or treatment supervised by health care workers.  As in the control arm, patients and their doctors in the intervention arms selected one of the three treatment monitoring approaches as per National Tuberculosis Control Program protocol.  The interventions had three common components: reminders for timely drug intake, reminders for monthly follow-up visits, and a recommendation for doctors to switch patients from self-administered treatment to a more intensive treatment monitoring approach when patients were found to have adherence problems based on data available to the managing doctor.  In the text messaging and combined arms, a text message reminded patients to take their medication at the time previously agreed on with the patient.  Similarly, in the medication monitor and combined arms, an audio reminder from the medication monitor box reminded patients to take their medication.  If the patient did not open the medication monitor by a pre-specified time, up to eight additional reminders sounded.  In all three intervention arms, patients received four reminders to attend the monthly dispensing visit.  At each monthly follow-up visit, the managing doctor evaluated adherence patterns.  Missed doses were defined as the larger of missed doses based on pill count or missed doses from missing SMS reply or from failure to open the medication monitor box.  If 12 doses were missed in the previous month, we recommended the doctor counsel the patient on the importance of adherence to medication but allowed self-administered treatment to continue.  The primary study endpoint for treatment adherence was the percentage of patient-months where at least 20% of doses were missed.  Measurement of the adherence endpoints utilised the same data for all four study arms and included data from the medication monitor box, downloaded into a database when patients returned for their monthly medication refill.  All adherence endpoints, except secondary endpoint 4, measured the number of missed doses per month as the larger of the number of missed doses from pill count or the number of failures to open the medication monitor box.  We also conducted a post hoc sensitivity analysis censoring adherence measurement at the time of loss to follow-up.  Routinely recorded data reported to the National Tuberculosis Control Program were used to define TB treatment outcomes.  Sample size calculations were based on a binary endpoint of non-adherence and took into account the study design.  Assuming nine clusters per arm, a two-sided type I error of 5%, and a percentage with non-adherence in the control arm of 30%, 110 TB patients per cluster would be required to detect a 40% reduction in the endpoint in the intervention arm with power of 90% and coefficient of variation of 0.25.  There were problems with loose batteries in some of the medication monitors, resulting in a power outage during which data on box openings were not captured.  The problem could be easily fixed by the patient or the doctor when they became aware of the problem We conducted a post hoc stratified analysis separating patient-months into those that had a record of a medication monitor problem and those that did not.  There was some variation between arms in the percentages analysed among those screened: 72.5%, 68.2%, 59.4%, and 69.8% in the control, text messaging, medication monitor, and combined arms, respectively.  Overall, 71.0% of participants were male, median age was 43 y, 56.0% were farmers, 7.9% were illiterate, median household income was 20,000 RMB, and 36.3% were smear positive.  Based on combining the data from pill counts and the medication monitor, the percentages of patients who should have been switched to intensive management or DOT, were 26.3% and 35.4%, respectively, in the text messaging arm, 16.2% and 24.1% in the medication monitor arm and 16.0% and 20.1% in the combined arm.  Minor problems with the mobile phones used to receive text messages were also common and were reported by 56.5% of those in the text messaging arm and 27.3% of those in the combined arm.  Problems with the medication monitor or phone were resolved in 88.7% of occurrences.  Our study found that the use of a medication monitor to remind TB patients to take their drugs reduced poor medication adherence by 40%50% compared to the standard of care in Chinas National Tuberculosis Control Program.  This reduction was seen for all TB treatment adherence measures in this study.  The use of text messaging did not reduce poor medication adherence but did reduce patient loss to follow-up by 58%.  The use of a medication monitor alone resulted in a smaller, and not statistically significant, reduction in patient loss to follow-up compared to control; however, the study was not powered for this treatment outcome.  Even though many types of EMP devices exist and have been used for different disease conditions, a recent systematic review concluded that there were limited data supporting their use in improving adherence.  This study is the first to our knowledge to utilise a randomised trial design to demonstrate the effectiveness of an EMP device in improving medication adherence in TB patients.  The use of our medication monitor box was integrated into the public health management of TB treatment.  Such integration seems to be more frequently associated with improved medication adherence.  As the largest study to date, to our knowledge, to evaluate an EMP device for any disease condition, this study provides important evidence supporting the use of EMP to improve medication adherence.  Our results demonstrate that text messaging did not reduce poor medication adherence among TB patients.  This contrasts with available evidence supporting the use of text messaging among HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy, which led to a strong recommendation from WHO for its use.  Frequent medication reminders using text messages can result in user fatigue.  Perhaps the lack of a more personalised engagement, the didactic nature of our messages, multiple messages per day, and the SMS message being received when the patient was not in close proximity to his/her medication all contributed to the failure to reduce poor adherence.  There has been recent interest in using mobile phone technology to improve adherence to TB medication and TB treatment outcomes, though, as yet, few studies have reported their findings.  In our intervention arms, we recommended that doctors switch patients to intensive patient management or DOT when adherence problems were documented.  Because problems with medication monitors, mobile phones, or their use were frequently reported, it is possible that doctors largely chose to ignore the electronic adherence data when deciding whether to switch patients to more intensive case-management approaches.  Even though more intensive case-management approaches were underutilised in the presence of recorded treatment non-adherence, we still observed better adherence in the medication monitor and combined arms.  This suggests that the use of a medication monitor to remind patients to take their medications can improve treatment adherence by itself.  If information on poor treatment adherence had been used by providers to switch patients to more intensive case-management approaches, as intended, it is likely we would have seen an even greater reduction in poor treatment adherence with the use of medication monitors.  Interestingly, text messaging reduced the risk of patient loss to follow-up.  Perhaps text messaging is an effective approach to remind patients of follow-up visits and resulted in better attendance at monthly visits.  However, a recent meta-analysis suggests that the effectiveness of SMS reminders for appointments is modest at best and not more effective than other types of reminders.  The differences in the effects of the interventions in terms of adherence and treatment outcome endpoints suggest these do not correlate well.  However, adherence is complex, and a recent taxonomy divides it into three constructsinitiation, implementation, and discontinuation.  Given that our primary adherence endpoint is predominantly implementation, the seemingly discrepant results are not surprising; the evidence did not change when the primary endpoint was restricted to implementation only, in a post hoc sensitivity analysis.  We defined poor adherence based on a threshold of 20% missed doses, a threshold commonly used in other disease areas.  First, the battery problems with the medication monitors in our study led to loss of data in some patients, potentially resulting in an over-estimation of poor adherence.  However, when we performed a stratified analysis using patient-months with or without this problem, we found similar reductions in poor treatment adherence.  Second, more intensive case-management approaches were underutilised, possibly because doctors disregarded information from the medication monitor or SMS feedback.  Third, for the adherence endpoints, we assumed that opening the medication monitor box was synonymous with drug intake, which may not have been the case, though our measure of poor adherence using a combination of this and pill count is arguably more robust than pill count alone.  Pill counts have often been shown to under-report poor adherence or non-adherence, as is also shown in our study, where the geometric mean for the adherence endpoint measured using pill count only was lower than that of the primary endpoint.  Further, data from a separate study indicated high correlation between adherence measured by medication monitor and rifampicin detected in urine.  Other limitations included differences in percentages enrolled by study arm, baseline imbalance of some factors, the unmasked nature of the trial, and the study not being powered for the treatment outcome endpoints.  In spite of these limitations, this is the largest study to date, to our knowledge, to evaluate the use of text messaging or medication monitors to improve medication adherence in TB patients.  As a pragmatic trial, implemented by the National Tuberculosis Control Program and mimicking real-world conditions, this study has produced useful lessons for future study designs.  The use of a medication monitor as a reminder for drug intake in combination with the identification of patients requiring more intensive management has been suggested as an approach for improving TB treatment adherence.  Based on our results, the use of a medication monitor shows great promise.  In a setting such as China, where universal use of DOT is not feasible, innovative approaches that help patients adhere to TB treatment are needed.  The development of a low-cost and reliable medication monitor, as well as evidence that its use can improve clinical outcomes, could enable widespread use of medication monitors in national TB control programmes.\n","Published by Public Library of Science ({PLoS}) authors Xiaoqiu Liu and James J.

Reimann and Tiziana Sonati, journal name {PLOS} Pathogens. Antibodies against the prion protein PrPC can antagonize prion replication and neuroinvasion, and therefore hold promise as possible therapeutics against prion diseases.  However, the safety profile of such antibodies is controversial.  It was originally reported that the monoclonal antibody D13 exhibits strong target-related toxicity, yet a subsequent study contradicted these findings.  We have reported that several antibodies against certain epitopes of PrPC, including antibody POM1, are profoundly neurotoxic, yet antibody ICSM18, with an epitope that overlaps with POM1, was reported to be innocuous when injected into mouse brains.  In order to clarify this confusing situation, we assessed the neurotoxicity of antibodies D13 and ICSM18 with dose-escalation studies using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and various histological techniques.  We report that both D13 and ICSM18 induce rapid, dose-dependent, on-target neurotoxicity.  We conclude that antibodies directed to this region may not be suitable as therapeutics.  No such toxicity was found when antibodies against the flexible tail of PrPC were administered.  Any attempt at immunotherapy or immunoprophylaxis of prion diseases should account for these potential untoward effects.  The human prion disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, is a progressive neurodegenerative syndrome.  Although far less prevalent, CJD shows many molecular and clinical similarities to Alzheimer's disease, such as the buildup of protein aggregates in the brain and the absence of effective treatments.  Many attempts at immunotherapy for Alzheimers disease are being reported in specialized journals and in the lay press, and have been linked to strong hopes for a cure.  However, there have also been reports that antibodies against the prion protein can also wreak damage on the brain.  We have gathered evidence that various antiprion antibodies vary not only in their efficacy but also in their potential to induce serious untoward effects.  In a dose-escalation study, we report that all antibodies against a set of epitopes in the globular domain of the prion protein display acute neurotoxicity.  Differential Toxicity of Antibodies to the Prion Protein.  Active and passive immunotherapy that foster the clearance of pathological aggregates represent potential therapeutic strategies against diseases caused by the inappropriate aggregation of proteins.  While considerable effort has been devoted to the immunotherapy of Alzheimer's disease with antibodies against the A protein, transmissible spongiform encephalopathies represent equally plausible candidates for this approach.  TSEs are caused by self-propagating aggregates of PrPSc, a conformer of the cellular prion protein PrPC encoded by the Prnp gene.  Active immunotherapeutic strategies in preclinical disease models have rarely yielded significant improvements in survival time after prion inoculation.  In addition, it has proven difficult to induce high-affinity immune responses to PrPC in wild-type mice even in the presence of a variety of adjuvants.  A first proof of concept for immunotherapies in prion disease was established with mice genetically engineered to express the heavy chain of an anti-PrPC antibody.  These mice were found to be protected against peripheral prion infection.  Later, it was observed that passive intraperitoneal immunization with antiprion antibodies ICSM18 and ICSM35 blocked peripheral infection with Rocky Mountain Laboratory strain mouse-adapted scrapie prions, although no beneficial effect was seen upon intracerebral inoculation.  With intravenous delivery of the antibodies 31C6, 110 and 44B1, a trend towards longer survival could be detected after intracerebral inoculation of the Chandler and Obihiro prion strains.  Additionally, osmotic minipumps were used to deliver antibody 31C6 intraventricularly, and this intervention led to a significant prolongation of survival in mice inoculated with prions intracerebrally.  On the other hand, chronic intracerebral administration of the antiprion antibody 4H11 resulted in severe side effects, including nerve cell loss, gliosis, and microglial activation.  Similar toxic side effects were detected by us and others after stereotaxic injection of various anti-PrPC antibodies, apparently strictly dependent on the particular PrPC epitope targeted by the respective antibody.  reported that they did not reproduce the neurotoxicity described for antibody D13.  Furthermore, they reported no acute toxicity in vivo for their own antibodies ICSM18 and ICSM35.  is surprising, not only because it contradicted earlier reports of D13 toxicity, including our findings of lesions upon injection of D13 into PrPC-overexpressing tga20 mice, but also because of our previously published results that 7/12 antibodies to the globular domain of PrPC are acutely neurotoxic.  Interestingly, crystallographic studies revealed that ICSM18 and the neurotoxic antibody POM1 share a conspicuous overlap in their respective epitopes.  In particular, both antibodies have close intermolecular contacts to the amino acid side chains Ser143, Asp144, Tyr145 and Lys204 of human PrP.  If residues with an interaction distance shorter than 5 Å are included, the shared interface between the two antibodies is even more impressive and encompasses 9 amino acids.  The apparent discrepancy in the toxicity of POM1 and ICSM18 is of great theoretical and practical interest.  Toxic anti-PrPC antibodies induce damage by triggering pathways similar to those detected in bona fide prion infections, including activation of calpains and the PERK pathway as well as the production of reactive oxygen species.  Mechanistically, the flexible tail at the amino-terminus of the prion protein mediates the toxicity of antiprion antibodies by binding to the globular domain of PrP.  Therefore, aside from the obvious issues of safety for human clinical trials, understanding why two antibodies directed against extremely similar epitopes might display such divergent on-target toxicity may advance our understanding of prion pathogenesis.  We stereotaxically injected antibody D13 into the left Cornu ammonis region-1 of the hippocampus of male 34 month old C57BL/6 mice.  We then reasoned that despite their monoclonal origin, the biological activity of antibodies can vary between batches.  Furthermore, even the assessment of protein concentration can vary between labs and can depend on the specific methodology utilized.  As the dose dependence of antiprion antibodies has already been demonstrated ex vivo; therefore, we examined the toxicity of D13 over a range of antibody concentrations.  We found TUNEL-positive cells in lesions of mice injected with 6 g, but not in the control injections with antigen-preincubated D13.  This result is in line with the previous report that the neurotoxicity of anti-PrPC antibodies does not lead to caspase activation and cannot be suppressed by caspase inhibition.  Next, we addressed the possible toxicity of antibody ICSM18 after intracerebral injection.  in 1/5 mice injected with 6 g of ICSM18, whereas no lesions were seen in the control group.  This finding raised concern that ICSM18 might be neurotoxic, yet statistical analysis failed to reveal significant differences between ICSM18 injections and contralateral isotype control injections in BL10 mice.  We therefore performed CA1 injection into tga20 and into prion protein-ablated mice for control.  We found that ICSM18 induced lesions in tga20 but not in Prnp°/° mice.  We therefore administered ICSM18 into the hippocampal CA3 region close to the dentate gyrus of tga20 mice.  Here, we found a more robust induction of neurotoxicity in contrast to the CA1 injection.  Using the CA3 injection coordinates, we then performed injections at 2 g and 6 g ICSM18 into BL10 mice, in order to estimate the boundaries of a safe dose.  To test for gender and strain-dependent effects, we injected 6 g ICSM18 into BL6 males and females.  We identified a trend towards more severe lesions in BL6 compared to BL10 females, but the differences were not significant.  As the binding interface of ICSM18 and POM1 overlaps we next asked if the deleterious effect of both antibodies is comparable.  Quantitative analysis revealed no significant difference between the toxicity of ICSM18 and POM1, whereas injection of POM1 pre-incubated with mrPrP did not induce a lesion.  In order to obtain information about the tissue penetration of intracerebrally injected antiprion antibodies, we used a previously described approach for chronically administering antiprion antibodies.  Therefore, POM2 could help evaluate the diffusion of high-affinity antiprion antibodies in the absence of tissue damage.  In both dose groups, only minimal Cy5 fluorescence was detected within the brain in one out of three injections.  Because of limited penetration, intrathecal injection of high-affinity antiprion holoantibodies will unlikely represent the optimal therapeutic choice against prion diseases, a disease that affects the entire brain.  Furthermore, stereotaxic intracerebral administration of a single dose of antiprion antibodies does not represent a realistic approximation of clinical drug administration.  No lesions were seen in Prnp°/° mice subjected to the same procedure.  This quantification may underestimate the overall tissue damage, as conspicuous astrogliosis and microgliosis were found in both hemispheres indicative of generalized brain involvement.  were unable to reproduce the initial report of D13 toxicity, and concluded from their experiments that \"PrP antibodies do not trigger mouse hippocampal neuron apoptosis\".  We found that both the ICSM18 and D13 antibodies are neurotoxic in paradigms seemingly identical to those used in the studies of Klöhn et al.  This outcome vividly depicts the necessity to perform accurate dose-escalation studies when studying the toxicity of potential therapeutics.  Beyond the obvious dosage-related issues, several additional confounders and pitfalls may have contributed to the inability of others to detect toxicity.  For example, the purity and age of antibody batches can affect toxicity in ways that may be subtle and difficult to control.  Possible explanations for this finding include the selective vulnerability of different neuronal populations in the hippocampus to antiprion antibodies.  Interestingly, we found a trend towards larger lesion in BL6 mice in contrast to the BL10 mice used by Klöhn et al, which probably also affected the detection of ICSM18 induced neurotoxicity.  Whilst we could reproduce the initial report of D13 neurotoxicity, we found the toxicity threshold to be higher than originally reported by Williamson et al.  This quantitative discrepancy is suggestive of different biological activities of the antibody batches used in previous studies and may be related to the specific methodologies used for protein generation and purification.  A difference in biological activities of both antibodies cannot be fully excluded, as it was not possible to generate both antibodies in our laboratory.  Thus, our data may not be sufficient to directly compare the two antibodies.  We therefore speculate that there is a relation between the binding epitope and dose-response relationship, which in line with the observation that toxicity is epitope-dependent.  Our results are not surprising considering that neurotoxicity was identified as a potential hazard of antiprion immunotherapy by many laboratories.  Since toxicity was found to be reproduced with single-chain variable fragments and F(ab)1 fragments of antibodies, it seems related to \"on-target\" interaction with PrP, rather than antibody effector functions.  Depending on the ratio between the dosage required for effectiveness and the toxicity threshold, such vulnerability may represent a surmountable obstacle for the development of therapeutic antibodies.  The first patients envisaged for clinical studies will likely be those suffering from sporadic CJD, since this is the most frequent prion disease in humans.  sCJD is hypothesized to begin with the spontaneous misfolding and aggregation of prion protein within the brain.  Accordingly, informative pre-clinical studies should prove the efficacy in disease models where prions are inoculated intracerebrally.  However, a cumulative dose of 8 mg of ICSM18 was shown to be ineffective against intracerebral prion inoculation.  It is plausible that the antibody passes through the blood brain barrier in sufficient amounts only at the terminal stage of the disease, as was found in the case of antibody 31C6.  The only published study on delivering anti-prion antibody via this route used 336 g to achieve a significant but small prolongation of survival in prion inoculated mice.  However, when we administered POM1 in a similar dose range intracerebroventricularly using osmotic minipumps, we found massive destruction of brain matter.  These results along with the lack of preclinical data on the chronic toxicity of ICSM18 mandate particular caution with respect to the possible intrathecal administration of ICSM18.  We considered the possible impact of species-specific Prnp polymorphisms on antibody toxicity.  After chronic scFvPOM1 delivery by osmotic minipumps, we found lesions similar in size and distribution to the previously described diffusion pattern of antiprion antibodies.  While sobering, these results do not indicate that antiprion immunotherapy is inherently unsafe.  In fact, we reported earlier that 5 of 12 POM antibodies tested against PrPC did not show any cytotoxicity in organotypic slice cultures, and the innocuousness of the octapeptide repeat ligand POM2 was confirmed in vivo with up to 6 g in PrPC-overexpressing tga20 mice.  Moreover, other antibodies including 31C6, 44B1, and 110, did not show untoward effects at high doses in preclinical efficacy studies.  A meta-analysis of many published studies points to a relationship between binding epitopes and neurotoxicity in vivo, with toxicity appears to be strictly dependent on well-defined epitopes of the globular domain of PrPC.  Neither of these two antibodies is described to engage epitopes on the 3 helix.  Hence engagement of the 3 helix may be important in mediating neurotoxicity.  However, this interpretation is currently speculative since D18 has not been tested in a rigorous dose-escalation study, nor has high-resolution epitope mapping been applied to these antibodies.  Conversely, antibodies binding the flexible tail of PrPC seem to be generally well-tolerated and, in our view, are more amenable to the development of safe and effective antiprion immunotherapies.  In organotypic slices, D13 showed limited intrinsic toxicity at relatively high concentrations.  However, when administered at lower concentration, D13 protected slices from POM1 toxicity.  In summary, these data illustrate that the efficacy profile of antiprion antibodies is complex and depends both on intrinsic factors such as, crucially, the nature of the engaged epitope, and extrinsic factors such as the route of administration.  Detailed analyses and mapping of the involved epitopes andmost importantlyappropriate dose-escalation studies in vivo are prerequisite not only for preparing clinical trials in humans, but also to avoid the reporting of contradictory, confusing, and potentially misleading results.

Cuomo and Cedric F. Garl, journal name {PLOS} {ONE}. There are 52,380 cases of leukemia and 24,090 deaths from it in the US annually.  We hypothesized that leukemia is due mainly to vitamin D deficiency, which is due mainly to low solar ultraviolet B irradiance.  To test this hypothesis, we estimated age-standardized cloud-cover-adjusted winter UVB irradiance using cloud cover data from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project, latitudes of population centroids, and standard astronomical calculations.  Incidence rates for 172 countries, available from the International Agency for Cancer Research, were plotted according to cloud-adjusted UVB irradiance.  Leukemia incidence rates were inversely associated with cloud-adjusted UVB irradiance in males and females in both hemispheres.  The bivariate association displayed by the polynomial trend line indicated that populations at higher latitudes had at least two times the risk of leukemia compared to equatorial populations.  The association persisted in males and females after controlling for elevation and life expectancy.  Incidence rates of leukemia were inversely associated with solar UVB irradiance.  It is plausible that the association is due to vitamin D deficiency.  This would be consistent with laboratory studies and a previous epidemiological study.  Consideration should be given to prudent use of vitamin D for prevention of leukemia.  Citation: Cuomo RE, Garland CF, Gorham ED, Mohr SB Low Cloud Cover-Adjusted Ultraviolet B Irradiance Is Associated with High Incidence Rates of Leukemia: Study of 172 Countries.  It was estimated that the United States had 52,380 new cases and 24,090 deaths from leukemia in 2014.  The four main subtypes of leukemia are chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, and acute myeloid leukemia.  These studies have supported a biological mechanism of action whereby leukemia cells are acted upon by vitamin D metabolites.  Levels of vitamin D can be increased either by consumption or increased exposure to ultraviolet B.  1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D has been found to aid myeloid leukemia differentiation to macrophages and monocytes.  One study found that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D resulted in differentiation by inhibiting the ERK5 pathway, thereby resulting in inhibition of G1 and G2 phases of the mitotic cycle.  Eleven of twelve leukemic mice administered long-term 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D were found to have undetectable tumors after three years.  A separate study also found that supplementation with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D increased survival time in mice with myeloid leukemia.  In humans, a clinical study found that lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels was associated with poorer relapse-free survival, a finding that persisted even after controlling for smoking and white blood cell count.  A case-control study found that all patients with acute leukemia had 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels below 20 ng/ml.  Though a number of biological and epidemiological studies have been conducted upon AML, the biological mechanisms associated with vitamin D metabolites support an even greater preventive potential for CLL.  Vitamin D metabolites have been shown to up-regulate epithelial cadherins, thereby stimulating contact inhibition of cancer, a well-known anticarcinogenic biological mechanism.  These public health risk factors facilitate a cellular environment that stimulates cellular proliferation, to which cells are more resilient when higher levels of vitamin D have encouraged stronger contact inhibition.  Therefore, vitamin D sufficiency may plausibly inhibit the development of CLL.  Since CLL constitutes a relatively large proportion of total leukemia incidence, epidemiological analyses that assess relationships with total leukemia incidence may be largely explaining variability from CLL, to which there exists biological plausibility for an association with vitamin D status, in addition to AML, to which there exists a preponderance of published biological evidence for an association with vitamin D status.  There are several known risk factors for leukemia, including exposure to ionizing radiation, exposure to organic solvents, and having Down syndrome.  While robust data on several population-level risk factors may not exist, country-level data on certain characteristics that may confound the relationship between UVB exposure and leukemia incidence are available.  Importantly, these include elevation, which may influence exposure to UVB, and life expectancy, which can influence risk for developing leukemia.  This study seeks to determine whether the global relationship between UVB exposure and leukemia incidence is consistent with laboratory and clinical findings of anticarcinogenic effects from higher levels of vitamin D. The main differences between this and a previous study are that in this paper the graphic analyses are based on cloud-adjusted UVB irradiance, while in the former paper the only graphics were for incidence rates by latitude; and this report is of data for 2012, a decade later than the data that were used in the previous research.  Age standardized rates of leukemia were obtained for males and females separately from the International Agency for Cancer Researchs Global Cancer 2012 database.  These incidence rates of leukemia were determined by IARC for each country using the best sources of surveillance data available.  Cloud cover-adjusted UVB was estimated for each country from cloud cover data, available from the National Aeronautics and Space Administrations International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project satellite, and from total noon solar irradiance at the winter solstice at the latitude of the population centroid of each country.  Wintertime UVB was used because it corresponds to populations whose vitamin D photosynthesis is lowest, thereby corresponding to the development of cancer in those populations.  Total noon solar irradiance was calculated from data on solar irradiance and geographic variations, available from NASA, and from latitude of population centroid, available from Columbia Universitys Center for International Earth Science Information Network.  The formula used to obtain total noon solar irradiance at the top of the atmosphere on the date of the winter solstice in the northern hemisphere is A' = A * cos, and the formula used to obtain these data for countries in the southern hemisphere is A' = A * cos.  Total solar irradiance was then multiplied by 0.004, because UVB has been estimated as 0.4% of total solar irradiance.  JMP software was used to plot incidence rates of sex-specific country-level leukemia against cloud cover-adjusted UVB with a polynomial trend line.  A graph was also constructed that displays the relationship between total country-level leukemia incidence and cloud cover-adjusted UVB while weighting for total country population in 2012.  To best display a potential equatorial association with cancer incidence, negative values were given to countries in the southern hemisphere.  ArcGIS v10.2 was used to produce a world map that displays graduated symbols for leukemia incidence in both sexes, on top of a choropleth gradient representing cloud cover-adjusted UVB for each country.  Though the correlation table and figures include nearly all countries, the involvement of additional covariates in regression models resulted in slightly fewer included countries.  Leukemia incidence rates for 172 countries were inversely associated with cloud-adjusted UVB irradiance in males and females in both hemispheres.  The association persisted in males and females after controlling for life elevation and sex-specific life expectancy  The results of this study show that populations with higher exposure to cloud cover-adjusted UVB irradiance experienced lower incidence rates of leukemia.  This is a novel advance in that leukemia incidence has not previously been compared to UVB irradiance after adjustment for cloud cover using satellite data.  Use of cloud-adjusted UVB irradiance provided compliance of the incidence rates to the parabolic curve.  Importantly, these results suggest that increased levels of UVB irradiance and vitamin D may help prevent development of leukemia.  Wavelengths between 270 and 300 nm allow for the creation of vitamin D in that they are absorbed by 7-dehydrocholesterol, a molecule found in the skin, which then undergoes photoconversion into vitamin D.  It then enters the bloodstream where it is metabolized to 25-hydroxyvitamin D in the liver, which then travels to the kidneys, where it is metabolized to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. In regard to prevention of leukemias, this molecule acts on vitamin D receptors in bone marrow to produce e-cadherins, which make up adherens junctions that bridge intracellular actin cytoskeletons.  This works in part by phosphorylating certain membrane proteins, which are then translocated to the nucleus, where this process results in transcription of G1-phase inhibitors, which control mitosis and therefore may help to prevent the uncontrolled proliferation of white blood cells that is characteristic of leukemia.  Several studies specifically conducted on HL-60 leukemia cells indicate that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D may mechanistically exert its effect through a cytosolic receptor on the MEK pathway in order to upregulate G1 phase inhibitors like p27Kip1 and p21Cip1, which are findings that support the likelihood of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin Ds influence on leukemia prevention by regulating transcription in favor of G1-phase inhibition.  Several epidemiological studies have suggested that inadequate levels of vitamin D may be a risk factor for the development of leukemia.  In the Harvard Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, it was discovered that a 25 nmol/L increase in modeled 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the primary metabolite of vitamin D, was associated with a 66% decrease in risk of leukemia.  It was possible that other risk factors for leukemia might have confounded the relationship between leukemia prevention and UVB exposure.  An individual at higher elevation may be slightly more exposed to UVB irradiance.  These wavelengths, which are more sensitive and less abundant than UVA wavelengths, would have to travel a shorter distance to reach an individual at higher elevation.  While this covariate itself was not significantly associated with sex-specific leukemia incidence in the regression models, it was nonetheless included in an attempt to correct for possible confounding.  Therefore, this covariate broadly captures variations in leukemia-promoting environments and behaviors that could not be exhaustively included in the model.  Furthermore, it has been documented that the skin tissue of older individuals has less 7-dehydrocholesterol, the molecule that converts to vitamin D upon interaction with UVB irradiance.  As a result of these qualities, the addition of this covariate adjusts for confounding of the relationship between UVB exposure and leukemia incidence.  Vitamin D replacement policies, such as fortification in food and discouragement of complete sun avoidance, may have the potential to lower leukemia incidence.  These policies have been pursued in certain Nordic countries, which have relatively high rates of several cancers and relatively low levels of UVB irradiation, but thorough documentation has not been published as to whether these policies have had sufficiently broad reach or whether levels of fortification are adequate.  It is worthwhile to note that vitamin D replacement policies could prudently target at-risk groups, especially the elderly, who have much higher rates of several cancers and have relatively lower levels of 7-dehydroxyvitamin D.  This study provides ecological evidence that supports prior findings among individuals and tissue samples.  This is consistent with ecological studies on colorectal and breast cancers, where the association between vitamin D deficiency and cancer had also been established in many studies of individuals, including major cohort studies and a randomized controlled clinical trial.  These analyses were not able to control for all confounders that may account for differences in leukemia risk between countries.  Some of these confounders may be very influential on risk for leukemia.  Furthermore, while this study did not suffer from bias derived from the collection of data, it is possible that the data source somewhat suffers from reporting bias, as population-based cancer registries in lower-income areas tend to cover lower proportions of inhabitants.  It is possible that the effect size for the association between cloud cover-adjusted UVB and sex-specific, age-standardized leukemia incidence may be somewhat exaggerated due to the use of wintertime exposure, which represents the minimum amount of UVB irradiance across seasons.  Also, grouping by subtypes of leukemia was not available from the GLOBOCAN database, so we were not able to distinguish between the different subtypes of leukemia.  If the findings were null, we would be concerned that grouping of subtypes of leukemia could have masked some of the true associations.  In conclusion, this study showed that leukemias association with UVB exposure appeared similar to those seen for breast and colorectal cancers.  As a result, the inverse association between cloudadjusted solar UVB exposure and incidence rates is likely to be mediated by circulating 25(OH)D, which is highly dependent on solar UVB irradiance.  Also, clinical studies have shown similar associations in individuals as those seen in this report between countries.  This study revealed a strikingly large difference in country-level leukemia risk when comparing equatorial countries to high-latitude countries.  Studies comparing large regions, such as countries or subnational entities, may be more likely find greater differences in disease risk, given that the distinction between two large regions may be more likely to encompass widely different cultural practices and norms, such as those pertaining to diet, the components of which broadly influence risk for chronic diseases.  While regression models in this study included life expectancy in order to control for this source of confounding, studies among individuals should be conducted in order to definitively determine whether differences in leukemia risk according to vitamin D status are consistent with those presented here with country-level UVB irradiance.\n","Published by Public Library of Science ({PLoS}) authors Raphael E.
