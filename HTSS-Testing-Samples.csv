A diversity of colorful beautifully patterned species lives in tandem with coral reefs around the world having adapted their appearance body structure and lifestyle to take refuge in the folds of spiny spongy slippery reefs.  	Recent studies suggest that coral reefs however are just as dependent on these fish for key nutrients that help coral grow. When fish urinate they release phosphorus into the water. This phosphorus along with nitrogen excreted as ammonium through the gills of fish is crucial to the survival and growth of coral reefs. 	A new study appearing Aug. 16 in Nature Communications takes this a step further finding that in coral reefs where fishing occurs nearly half of these key nutrients are absent from the ecosystem. The main reason? Fewer large-bodied and predator fish to pee nutrients into the water the study found. 	""Part of the reason coral reefs work is because animals play a big role in moving nutrients around "" said lead author Jacob Allgeier a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Washington's School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences. 	""Fish hold a large proportion if not most of the nutrients in a coral reef in their tissue and they're also in charge of recycling them. If you take the big fish out you're removing all of those nutrients from the ecosystem."" 	Paper co-authors Abel Valdivia at the Center for Biological Diversity in San Francisco and Courtney Cox at Smithsonian Marine Station at Fort Pierce Florida surveyed 143 fish species at 110 sites across 43 Caribbean coral reefs that varied in the amount of fishing pressure sustained -- ranging from marine preserves that banned all fishing to heavily fished reefs where large predator fish are almost gone.  The researchers found that reefs with more large predator fish had healthy levels of nutrients while reefs depleted of large fish had nearly 50 percent fewer nutrients including phosphorous and nitrogen essential to their survival. ""This study is useful to understand alternative ways fishing is affecting coral reef ecosystems "" Allgeier said.  The researchers determined that despite the substantial reduction in fish-mediated nutrients fishing didn't substantially reduce the number of fish species present. Instead the large reductions in fish pee were driven by the reduction of large-bodied fish and predator fish such as grouper snapper or barracuda that occurs through selective fishing practices. ""Simply stated fish biomass in coral reefs is being reduced by fishing pressure. If biomass is shrinking there are fewer fish to pee "" Allgeier said. Phosphorus in fish pee and nitrogen excreted through their gills are important nutrients for coral reefs to grow. In many reef communities fish will take shelter in and around coral during the day -- peeing out valuable nutrients -- then forage for prey in and around the reef by night.  A Science paper in the 1980s showed that coral reefs where fish were present grew at more than double the speed of reefs where fish were absent. It was this study undertaken by now emeritus research professor Judith Meyer at the University of Georgia that inspired Allgeier to figure out why fish help coral reefs grow. Coral reefs are the very definition of a delicate ecosystem. They are highly productive in terms of the biodiversity they support but there aren't a lot of nutrients to spare. Reefs operate on what scientists call a ""tight"" nutrient cycle meaning there must be an efficient transfer of nutrients for coral to grow. This cycle is largely controlled by fish which hold nutrients in their tissue and then excrete them through their gills and urine. Allgeier spent four years measuring the amount of nutrients in fish pee and fish tissue to eventually build a massive dataset that tracks fish size and nutrient output and the amount they store in their tissue.  As a graduate student Allgeier's kitchen on Abaco Island in the Bahamas became his lab and he caught hundreds of live fish put them in plastic bags for half an hour then measured the nutrients in the water before and after. He found that nitrogen output varied consistently with body size among all fish and that carnivorous fish would pee more phosphorus than smaller herbivores.  Now with these data serving as the basis for their models Allgeier and collaborators can estimate the total amount of nutrient output from fish by knowing the species and body size of fish in a coral reef community. ""It's remarkable how robust the models are just from knowing fish size and species "" he added.  	Coral reefs continue to decline in the Caribbean and worldwide but curbing fishing practices that target large predator fish could help reefs recover Allgeier said. 	The researchers expect this relationship between fish and coral exists in other reefs around the world. Allgeier is currently working with researchers at the University of California Santa Barbara to collect data next on fish pee in tropical Pacific Ocean reefs essentially building upon the data collection Allgeier did as a graduate student. 	### Craig Layman at North Carolina State University is the paper's other co-author and a longtime collaborator of Allgeier on this area of research.

Here, we test how fishing on Caribbean coral reefs influences biodiversity and ecosystem functions provided by the fish community, that is, fish-mediated nutrient capacity.  Specifically, we modelled five processes of nutrient storage (in biomass) and supply (via excretion) of nutrients, as well as a measure of their multifunctionality, onto 143 species of coral reef fishes across 110 coral reef fish communities.  These communities span a gradient from extreme fishing pressure to protected areas with little to no fishing.  We find that in fished sites fish-mediated nutrient capacity is reduced almost 50%, despite no substantial changes in the number of species.  Instead, changes in community size and trophic structure were the primary cause of shifts in ecosystem function.  These findings suggest that a broader perspective that incorporates predictable impacts of fishing pressure on ecosystem function is imperative for effective coral reef conservation and management.' 'Biodiversity theory has provided important motivation for conservation efforts globally1.  Theory largely has been supported by empirical data, but has often been limited to ecosystems with relatively few species and simplistic scenarios of community change, for example, random extinctions2.  Yet many of the ecosystems most impacted by humans are among the most diverse, including tropical rainforests and coral reefs, and impacts are often non-random, disproportionately affecting certain aspects of communities3.  While biodiversity conservation per se is imperative, additional human-driven changes to communities may necessitate additional conservation targets.  ', 'The productivity of many ecosystems depends on the nutrient capacity of the ecosystem; here defined as the total nutrients stored within, and the rate at which nutrients are recycled between the constituents of the system (the ambient nutrient availability, and the nutrients stored within plant and animal biomass)4,5.  Coral reefs are replete with solar energy, but have low ambient nutrient availability and typically receive little sustained exogenous nutrient input (notable exceptions may be increased nutrient input associated with seasonal rains or upwelling)5,6.  Thus, the high rates of production found within these ecosystems are largely attributed to the nutrients stored and cycled by living biomass7,8,9.  ', 'Fishes typically make up a substantial component of living biomass on coral reefs and represent an important reservoir of nutrients in these ecosystems10,11.  The removal of biomass via fishing likely has substantial implications for the nutrient capacity of coral reefs because: (1) nutrients are removed from the system and (2) existing nutrients are shunted into alternative pathways and storage pools such as, invertebrates, macroalgae and microorganisms.  Further, because exogenous nutrient inputs to reefs are sparse, the replacement rate of nutrients that are removed via fishing is likely slow7,8,12a dynamic that is analogous to the disruption of nutrient cycles in tropical rainforests following intensive timber harvest13.  ', 'Fish-mediated nutrient capacity is determined by a complex combination of species-level traits, such as stoichiometry and metabolism, that scale with individual body size14.  At the community level, fish nutrient capacity is determined by distinct aspects of community structure beyond biomass11,15.  For instance, richness, evenness and size structure of species within the community drive variation in fish nutrient capacity across relatively unimpacted coastal fish communities in the Caribbean15.  Yet, it is unknown how fishing pressure, particularly through selective exploitation of certain species, alters fish nutrient capacity of coral reef ecosystems.  ', 'Here we estimated the effects of fishing pressure on coral reef fish nutrient capacity in 110 fish communities on 43 Caribbean coral reefs (Supplementary Fig 1).  Pressure ranged from reefs with minimal fishing within relatively well-enforced no-take marine reserves, to heavily fished reefs with no protection where large predatory fish are mostly absent and overall size distribution of fish communities are relatively small (Supplementary Table 1).  Our goals were to: (1) test how different aspects of fish community structure, including richness, evenness, trophic structure, size structure and biomass, influence fish nutrient capacity; (2) assess how fishing pressure alters fish nutrient capacity across a fishing gradient; and (3) identify the primary drivers of reduced fish nutrient capacity due to fishing pressure.  ', 'Our results support commonly assumed theoretical relationships between species richness and ecosystem function; however, when accounting for the biomass of the communities, this relationship is nonexistent.  Fishing reduced fish-mediated nutrient processes by nearly half, but, contrary to expectations, reduction in nutrient processes was not due to species loss.  Instead, changes in trophic and size structure of the fish community was the main driver in reduced ecosystem function.  Species extirpation/extinction is a critical conservation concern, but our analysis suggests that efforts to preserve trophic groups and community size structure are also needed to maintain fish-mediated nutrient capacity in coral reef ecosystems.'

Researchers published results of a novel study of the functional activation patterns of working memory after mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). This study the first to enroll subjects during their initial evaluation in the emergency room provides new information on the acute effects of TBI on cognition. The fMRI studies conducted at <72 hours after injury and at one week after TBI provide neuroimaging evidence for working memory deficits during the week following injury. The article Cognitive improvement after mild traumatic brain injury measured with functional neuroimaging during the acute period was published by PLOS ONE (doi: 10.137/journal.pone.0126110). The authors are Glenn Wylie of Kessler Foundation and the War-related Illness and Injury Study Center of the Dept. of Veterans Affairs East Orange VA Hospital and Kalev Freeman Alex Thomas Marina Shpaner Michael O'Keefe Richard Watts and Magdalena Taylor of the University of Vermont. Forty-six participants were enrolled; 27 with isolated mild TBI and 19 controls who had nonsurgical extremity injuries and no head trauma. All underwent fMRI and Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT). At one week followup 64% of the TBI subjects reported moderate to complete recovery. Cognitive improvement corresponded with normalization of activation patterns on fMRI. ""We were interested in the effect of concussion on working memory immediately following injury and after one week of recovery "" explained Glenn Wylie DPhil associate director of the Rocco Ortenzio Neuroimaging Center at Kessler Foundation. ""We found increased activation in TBI subjects compared with controls "" noted Dr. Wylie. ""Also activation increased as workload increased in the TBI group and increases were greater in those whose cognition failed to improve. This study is the first step toward understanding the early effects of mild TBI on cognition. Predicting recovery will require the development of effective low-cost measures that correlate with changes in patterns of brain activation.""### The study was funded by an internal grant from the Department of Surgery at the University of Vermont (K.F.) and Kessler Foundation.

We sought to distinguish acute and delayed effects of mild traumatic brain injury on working memory functional brain activation patterns less_than 72 hours after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and again one-week later.  We hypothesized that clinical and fMRI measures of working memory would be abnormal in symptomatic mTBI patients assessed less_than 72 hours after injury, with most patients showing clinical recovery (i.e., improvement in these measures) within 1 week after the initial assessment.  We also hypothesized that increased memory workload at 1 week following injury would expose different cortical activation patterns in mTBI patients with persistent post-concussive symptoms, compared to those with full clinical recovery.  We performed a prospective, cohort study of working memory in emergency department patients with isolated head injury and clinical diagnosis of concussion, compared to control subjects (both uninjured volunteers and emergency department patients with extremity injuries and no head trauma).  The primary outcome of cognitive recovery was defined as resolution of reported cognitive impairment and quantified by scoring the subjects reported cognitive post-concussive symptoms at 1 week.  Secondary outcomes included additional post-concussive symptoms and neurocognitive testing results.  We enrolled 46 subjects: 27 with mild TBI and 19 controls.  The time of initial neuroimaging was 48 (+22 S.D.)  hours after injury (time 1).  At follow up (8.7, + 1.2 S.D., days after injury, time 2), 18 of mTBI subjects (64%) reported moderate to complete cognitive recovery, 8 of whom fully recovered between initial and follow-up imaging.  fMRI changes from time 1 to time 2 showed an increase in posterior cingulate activation in the mTBI subjects compared to controls.  Increases in activation were greater in those mTBI subjects without cognitive recovery.  As workload increased in mTBI subjects, activation increased in cortical regions in the right hemisphere.  In summary, we found neuroimaging evidence for working memory deficits during the first week following mild traumatic brain injury.  Subjects with persistent cognitive symptoms after mTBI had increased requirement for posterior cingulate activation to complete memory tasks at 1 week following a brain injury.  These results provide insight into functional activation patterns during initial recovery from mTBI and expose the regional activation networks that may be involved in working memory deficits.

Researchers from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine UK and the National Center for Tuberculosis Control and Prevention China conducted a trial with 4 173 patients from the provinces of Heilongjiang Jiangsu Hunan and Chongqing. Patients either received text message reminders an electronic medication monitor both or no reminders for their six month treatment period. Patients receiving no reminders missed taking 29.9% of their medication doses and patients receiving text messages missed 27.3% of their doses. However patients with an electronic medication monitor box - which beeped if not opened at the agreed time - only missed 17% of their medication doses. Patients who received both text messages and an electronic medication monitor missed just 13.9% of medication doses. According to the World Health Organization China has the world's second largest number of TB cases accounting for 11% of the estimated 9 million global cases. TB treatment usually lasts for six months and is effective if taken fully but patients missing drug treatment doses is a major problem. This increases the risk of having a relapse of TB and also TB becoming drug resistant making the disease more difficult to treat and potentially fatal. Senior author Dr Katherine Fielding of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine said: ""Global plans to reduce TB advise that treatment be taken under the direct observation of a healthcare worker to reduce missed doses something which has been difficult to carry out in many parts of China particularly in rural areas as in other parts of world. Innovative approaches are needed to tackle this problem. ""Our study is the first large-scale randomised trial to carefully evaluate whether electronic reminders can help patents to take their tuberculosis treatment on their own. Our findings show real promise. A low-cost reliable electronic medication monitor could improve TB treatment for thousands of people across China."" Project investigator Dr Shiwen Jiang of the National Center for Tuberculosis Control and Prevention added: ""Directly observed therapy is difficult to implement in China due to limited human resources poor acceptance and other factors. Our study aimed to assess whether the use of the medication monitor and/or text messaging can improve adherence to TB drugs. Our results are encouraging. We are currently planning a further evaluation of a management model including the use the medication monitor on long-term TB outcomes including TB recurrence. China plans to scale up the use of medication monitors in some provinces in the next five years."" The authors note their findings may have been limited due to battery problems with the medication monitor leading to loss of data for some patients. ### The research was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

We assessed the effectiveness of text messaging and medication monitors to improve medication adherence in TB patients. In a pragmatic cluster-randomised trial, 36 districts/counties (each with at least 300 active pulmonary TB patients registered in 2009) within the provinces of Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, Hunan, and Chongqing, China, were randomised using stratification and restriction to one of four case-management approaches in which patients received reminders via text messages, a medication monitor, combined, or neither (control).  Patients in the intervention arms received reminders to take their drugs and reminders for monthly follow-up visits, and the managing doctor was recommended to switch patients with adherence problems to more intensive management or DOT.  In all arms, patients took medications out of a medication monitor box, which recorded when the box was opened, but the box gave reminders only in the medication monitor and combined arms.  Patients were followed up for 6 mo.  The primary endpoint was the percentage of patient-months on TB treatment where at least 20% of doses were missed as measured by pill count and failure to open the medication monitor box.  Secondary endpoints included additional adherence and standard treatment outcome measures.  Interventions were not masked to study staff and patients.  From 1 June 2011 to 7 March 2012, 4,292 new pulmonary TB patients were enrolled across the 36 clusters.  A total of 119 patients (by arm: 33 control, 33 text messaging, 23 medication monitor, 30 combined) withdrew from the study in the first month because they were reassessed as not having TB by their managing doctor (61 patients) or were switched to a different treatment model because of hospitalisation or travel (58 patients), leaving 4,173 TB patients (by arm: 1,104 control, 1,008 text messaging, 997 medication monitor, 1,064 combined).  The cluster geometric mean of the percentage of patient-months on TB treatment where at least 20% of doses were missed was 29.9% in the control arm; in comparison, this percentage was 27.3% in the text messaging arm (adjusted mean ratio [aMR] 0.94, 95% CI 0.71, 1.24), 17.0% in the medication monitor arm (aMR 0.58, 95% CI 0.42, 0.79), and 13.9% in the combined arm (aMR 0.49, 95% CI 0.27, 0.88).  Patient loss to follow-up was lower in the text messaging arm than the control arm (aMR 0.42, 95% CI 0.180.98).  Equipment malfunction or operation error was reported in all study arms.  Analyses separating patients with and without medication monitor problems did not change the results.  Initiation of intensive management was underutilised. This study is the first to our knowledge to utilise a randomised trial design to demonstrate the effectiveness of a medication monitor to improve medication adherence in TB patients.  Reminders from medication monitors improved medication adherence in TB patients, but text messaging reminders did not.  In a setting such as China where universal use of DOT is not feasible, innovative approaches to support patients in adhering to TB treatment, such as this, are needed.

Immunotherapy to ameliorate neurodegeneration by targeting brain protein aggregates with antibodies is an area of intense investigation. A study published on January 28th in PLOS Pathogens examines seemingly contradictory earlier results of targeting the prion protein and proposes a cautionary way forward to further test related therapeutic approaches. Damaging aggregation of proteins in the brain is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases. In prion diseases such as Creutzfeld-Jakob disease aggregates of abnormally folded versions of the PrP protein cause the death of brain cells. The use of anti-PrP antibodies to target such aggregates and mediate their destruction by the immune system has been proposed as a therapy with the caveat that such antibodies could themselves be toxic. Prompted by the publication of seemingly contradictory reports on the potential neurotoxicity of antibodies against the prion protein in mice Adriano Aguzzi from the University of Zurich Switzerland and colleagues set out to rigorously test several antibodies side-by-side. The researchers examined whether toxicity was influenced by where and how the antibodies were delivered into the brain the antibody dose which area on the PrP protein the antibodies bind to and the genetic background of the mice. For several of the antibodies they found toxicity depended strictly on the administered dose results that could explain some of the seemingly different earlier results. Other factors tested including which target regions (or epitopes) on the PrP protein the antibodies bound to also seemed to affect the toxicity of at least some antibodies. Because the researchers observed toxicity for most of the antibodies that bind to the so-called globular region of PrP they conclude that such antibodies might not be suitable for immunotherapy. In contrast since no toxicity was found in tests of antibodies against the flexible tail region of PrP they suggest that those might be more promising candidates. ""In summary"" they say ""these data illustrate that the efficacy profile (i.e. the curative effectiveness versus the potential toxicity) of anti-prion antibodies is complex and depends both on intrinsic factors such as crucially the nature of the engaged epitope and extrinsic factors such as the route of administration. Detailed analyses and mapping of the involved epitopes and--most importantly--appropriate dose-escalation studies in vivo are prerequisite not only for preparing clinical trials in humans but also to avoid the reporting of contradictory confusing and potentially misleading results."" ### Please use this URL to provide readers access to the paper (Link goes live upon article publication): http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005401 Authors and Affiliations: Regina R.

However, the safety profile of such antibodies is controversial.  It was originally reported that the monoclonal antibody D13 exhibits strong target-related toxicity, yet a subsequent study contradicted these findings.  We have reported that several antibodies against certain epitopes of PrPC, including antibody POM1, are profoundly neurotoxic, yet antibody ICSM18, with an epitope that overlaps with POM1, was reported to be innocuous when injected into mouse brains.  In order to clarify this confusing situation, we assessed the neurotoxicity of antibodies D13 and ICSM18 with dose-escalation studies using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and various histological techniques.  We report that both D13 and ICSM18 induce rapid, dose-dependent, on-target neurotoxicity.  We conclude that antibodies directed to this region may not be suitable as therapeutics.  No such toxicity was found when antibodies against the flexible tail of PrPC were administered.  Any attempt at immunotherapy or immunoprophylaxis of prion diseases should account for these potential untoward effects. Author_  The human prion disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), is a progressive neurodegenerative syndrome.  Although far less prevalent, CJD shows many molecular and clinical similarities to Alzheimer's disease, such as the buildup of protein aggregates in the brain and the absence of effective treatments.  Many attempts at immunotherapy for Alzheimers disease are being reported in specialized journals and in the lay press, and have been linked to strong hopes for a cure.  The same therapeutic strategy appears plausible for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and indeed, there are some encouraging preclinical studies.  However, there have also been reports that antibodies against the prion protein (PrPC) can also wreak damage on the brain.  We have gathered evidence that various antiprion antibodies vary not only in their efficacy but also in their potential to induce serious untoward effects.  In a dose-escalation study, we report that all antibodies against a set of epitopes in the globular domain of the prion protein display acute neurotoxicity.  These issues need to be carefully assessed before considering any clinical studies involving human subjects.

The findings are published in the Dec. 4 2015 online issue of PLOS One. ""These results suggest that much of the burden of leukemia worldwide is due to the epidemic of vitamin D deficiency we are experiencing in winter in populations distant from the equator "" said Cedric Garland DrPH adjunct professor in the Department of Family Medicine and Public Health and member of Moores Cancer Center at UC San Diego Health. ""People who live in areas with low solar ultraviolet B exposure tend to have low levels of vitamin D metabolites in their blood "" Garland said. ""These low levels place them at high risk of certain cancers including leukemia."" Few foods are natural sources of vitamin D which is more abundantly produced when ultraviolet radiation from sunlight strikes the skin and triggers synthesis.  According to the American Cancer Society 54 270 cases and 24 450 deaths from leukemia occur in the United States alone each year. There is no known way to prevent most types of leukemia though some types may be prevented by avoiding high doses of ionizing radiation exposure to the chemical benzene smoking and certain types of chemotherapy. The UC San Diego study analyzed age-adjusted incidence rates of leukemia in 172 countries from GLOBOCAN an international agency for research on cancer that is part of the World Health Organization comparing that information with cloud cover data from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project. The study follows similar investigations by Garland and colleagues of other cancers including breast colon pancreas bladder and multiple myeloma. In each study they found that reduced UVB radiation exposure and lower vitamin D levels were associated with higher risks of cancer. Leukemia rates were highest in countries relatively closer to the poles such as Australia New Zealand Chile Ireland Canada and the United States. They were lowest in countries closer to the equator such as Bolivia Samoa Madagascar and Nigeria.

Its causes are unknown and no preventive strategies have been implemented.  We hypothesized that leukemia is due mainly to vitamin D deficiency, which is due mainly to low solar ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiance.  To test this hypothesis, we estimated age-standardized cloud-cover-adjusted winter UVB irradiance using cloud cover data from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project, latitudes of population centroids, and standard astronomical calculations.  Incidence rates for 172 countries, available from the International Agency for Cancer Research, were plotted according to cloud-adjusted UVB irradiance.  We used multiple regression to account for national differences in elevation and average life expectancy.  Leukemia incidence rates were inversely associated with cloud-adjusted UVB irradiance in males (p  0.01) and females (p  0.01) in both hemispheres.  There were few departures from the trend line, which was parabolic when plotted with the equator at the center of the display, northern hemisphere countries on the right side and southern hemisphere countries on the left.  The bivariate association displayed by the polynomial trend line indicated that populations at higher latitudes had at least two times the risk of leukemia compared to equatorial populations.  The association persisted in males (p  0.05) and females (p  0.01) after controlling for elevation and life expectancy.  Incidence rates of leukemia were inversely associated with solar UVB irradiance.  It is plausible that the association is due to vitamin D deficiency.  This would be consistent with laboratory studies and a previous epidemiological study.  Consideration should be given to prudent use of vitamin D for prevention of leukemia.
