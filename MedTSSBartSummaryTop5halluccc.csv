Fishing down nutrients on coral reefs	Published by Springer Science and Business Media {LLC} authors Jacob E. Allgeier and Abel Valdivia, journal name Nature Communications.	['Fishing is widely considered a leading cause of biodiversity loss in marine environments. The potential effect on ecosystem processes, such as nutrient fluxes, is less explored. Coral reefs are replete with solar energy, but have low ambient nutrient availability and typically receive little sustained exogenous nutrient input. Changes in community size and trophic structure were the primary cause of shifts in ecosystem function. These findings suggest that a broader perspective that incorporates predictable impacts of fishing pressure on ecosystem function is imperative for effective coral reef conservation and management.', 'Each process was modelled onto 72,824 individual fish in 43 fore-reefs in five Caribbean countries surveyed for multiple years. Recent evidence has shown that reef fish biomass may take 3560 years to recover from heavily depleted levels29. The study was published by Springer Science and Business Media {LLC} authors Jacob E. Allgeier and Abel Valdivia, journal name Nature Communications.', ' Theory largely has been supported by empirical data, but has often been limited to ecosystems with relatively few species. Yet many of the ecosystems most impacted by humans are among the most diverse, including tropical rainforests and coral reefs. impacts are often non-random, disproportionately affecting certain aspects of communities. The findings are published in the journal Nature Communications, published by Springer Science and Business Media {LLC)', 'Violain bars with a white centre bar indicate reefs on which fishing occurs versus a black centre bar indicating protected reefs. Barplots show differences between reefs that experience fishing and are protected. All differences are significant, according to the authors of the study.

Cognitive Improvement after Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Measured with Functional Neuroimaging during the Acute Period	Published by Public Library of Science ({PLoS}) authors Glenn R. Wylie and Kalev Freeman, journal name {PLOS} {ONE}.	[' functional neuroimaging studies in mild traumatic brain injury have been largely limited to patients with persistent post-concussive symptoms. Glenn R. Wylie and Kalev Freeman conducted a prospective, cohort study of working memory in emergency department patients with isolated head injury and clinical diagnosis of concussion. The primary outcome of cognitive recovery was defined as resolution of reported cognitive impairment and quantified by scoring subjects.', 'Brain MRI data was acquired on a Philips Achieva 3.0 Tesla scanner using an 8-channel head coil. A sagittal acquisition matrix of 240x240x160 provided whole-brain coverage with an isotropic 1mm spatial resolution with a scan time of less than 8 minutes. The time of initial neuroimaging was 48. All images were preprocessed using Analysis of Functional Neuro-Images.', 'The transforms necessary to realign, co-register and warp the data into standard space were combined and applied to the functional time-series data in a single transformation.

Effectiveness of Electronic Reminders to Improve Medication Adherence in Tuberculosis Patients: A Cluster-Randomised Trial	Published by Public Library of Science ({PLoS}) authors Xiaoqiu Liu and James J. Lewis, journal name {PLOS} Medicine.	['In a pragmatic cluster-randomised trial, 36 districts/counties within the provinces of Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, Hunan, and Chongqing, China, were randomised using stratification and restriction to one of four case-management approaches. Patients received reminders via text messages, a medication monitor, combined, or neither. The trial was designed to be pragmatic, and so we did not enforce the initiation of more intensive management.', 'Mobile text messaging and medication monitors have the potential to improve adherence to tuberculosis treatment. To our knowledge they have not been properly evaluated in TB patients. In China, where 11% of tuberculosis cases occur, DOT cannot be implemented in many parts of the country. In a setting such as China where universal use of DOT is not feasible, innovative approaches to support patients in adhering to TB treatment, such as this, are needed.', 'Every year, about 9 million people develop tuberculosis and at least 1.3 million people die as a result. In 2013, China ranked second in the world in number of tuberculosis cases, accounting for 11% of the estimated 9 million global cases. Tuberculosis can be cured by taking antibiotics daily for several months, but the emergence of multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis is making tuberculosis increasingly hard to treat.', 'Clusters were defined as rural counties or urban districts within the provinces of Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, Hunan, and Chongqing. Clusters were located in northern, eastern, central, and western China, respectively. The study was published in the journal PLOS Medicine, published by the Public Library of Science (PLoS) authors Xiaoqiu Liu and James J. Lewis.', 'Once the patient replied to the SMS reminder, with or without text, the reminders were stopped for that day. Once the box was opened, the reminder was stopped for the day.

Differential Toxicity of Antibodies to the Prion Protein	Published by Public Library of Science ({PLoS}) authors Regina R. Reimann and Tiziana Sonati, journal name {PLOS} Pathogens.	['The authors pledge to distribute all reagents described in this article, and particularly POM antibodies and derivatives therefrom, with all interested parties at fair market value. Animal care and all experimental protocols were in accordance with the Swiss Ethical Principles and Guidelines for Experiments on Animals. All animal care and protocol guidelines were obtained from http://www.blv.admin.ch/themen/tierschutz/index.html?lang=en and strictly adhered to by the experimenters and animal facility.', "Antibodies against the prion protein PrPC can antagonize prion replication and neuroinvasion. The safety profile of such antibodies is controversial. The human prion disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, is a progressive neurodegenerative syndrome. Although far less prevalent, CJD shows many molecular and clinical similarities to Alzheimer's disease and the absence of effective treatments.", ' activated caspase-3 immunohistochemistry labelled only a few cells. sections were deparaffinized through xylol and graded alcohols. 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride hydrate hydrate was labelled with a specific biotinylated secondary antibody. For immunohists, sections were washed with PBS and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature.', 'In order to exclude gender and strain-dependent confounders, we performed this experiment in female C57BL/10 mice as in Klöhn et al. Mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions. For MEMRI, mice received five intraperitoneal injections of MnCl2 at 12h intervals. For imaging acquisition, the mice were placed under isoflurane anesthesia at 4h, 24h and 72h post-surgery.', 'Volumetric quantification of the lesions seen by MEMRI image indicated that 9±3% of the total brain volume in tga20 mice, and 1±0% in Prnp°/° mice, was affected. Another explanation is that extracellular fluid is drained differentially from distinct brain sites. For the BMD analysis of D13 and ICSM18 we used the mean and maximal lesion volume from the 12 g D13 injection group, 3.68 mm3 and 40 mm3 respectively.']
Low Cloud Cover-Adjusted Ultraviolet B Irradiance Is Associated with High Incidence Rates of Leukemia: Study of 172 Countries	Published by Public Library of Science ({PLoS}) authors Raphael E. Cuomo and Cedric F. Garl, journal name {PLOS} {ONE}.	['There are 52,380 cases of leukemia and 24,090 deaths from it in the US annually. We hypothesized that leukemia is due mainly to vitamin D deficiency. We estimated age-standardized cloud-cover-adjusted winter UVB irradiance. populations at higher latitudes had at least two times the risk of leukemia compared to equatorial populations. The association persisted in males and females after controlling for elevation and life expectancy.', 'The newer method of analysis, which took cloud cover into account, yielded a substantially superior model. Through an ecologic study design, SAS software was used to analyze data using multiple linear regression. These values were then multiplied by in order to adjust for cloud cover. The results were published in the journal PLOS ONE, which is published by the Public Library of Science (PLOS) - the open-access journal.', 'As this study did not involve people, medical records, human tissues, or any other personally identifiable information, it did not require approval from an Institutional Review Board.
